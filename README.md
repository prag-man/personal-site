> *a place where i dump my thoughts, ideas, updates, and any shitty things i do*

**pragman's corner of the internet** — where a 19-year-old self-taught dev pretends to code while actually just hitting "tab" 1000 times a day.

## ✨ what's inside

- **thoughts** — random brain dumps and technical musings
- **projects** — stuff i've built (and probably broke)
- **contact** — slide into my digital DMs
- **guestbook** — leave your mark


*built with ❤️ and excessive amounts of diet coke*
